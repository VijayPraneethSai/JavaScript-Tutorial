<!-- ES6 is the biggest update -->

<!-- let and const -->

<!-- difference in let and var -->
1. var is global object property but let is not
2. var can be redeclared but let cannot be

<!-- const -->
const is used for variables that we dont want to change at all, like math constants(pi, G, K etc)
